# Project Description

> Virtual Doctor

- For the duration of this semester, as a part of our Software Engineering Lab Project, we will be building Virtual Doctor. Virtual Doctor addresses an opportunity to provide an application that helps patients identify their real problems or disease and suggest appropriate doctors for the specific situation. It will minimize the peopleâ€™s searching time and pain.
- More specifically, this system allows patients to identify their problem and provide a list of doctors by their category related to the patientâ€™s problem. Later, the patient can also request an appointment with the doctor through our system. And can even get the medications within the system as well

# Features Implemented

- Our application's primary purpose is to register and preserve complete medical data for patients. Users will be able to locate the doctor they require using the app. The user's criteria and input will determine the outcome.
- They can use the app to schedule a customized appointment for their condition. Patients can also use video chat/email to contact the doctor's office for any information, get diagnosis reports, and get advice on their current medical concerns.
- An email will be used when a patient has to be reminded of an important date or time. To access all of the application's components, the administrator must first register and sign up with special authorization. The Administrator can verify the authentication of the doctor and pharmacist before serving on the system.

# Thought Behind The Project

Due to the COVID-19 epidemic, the globe is now undergoing a massive global health catastrophe. Travel is one of the most directly impacted situations. Several regions have enacted stricter regulations, such as a lockdown or stay-at-home orders, to contain the public health crisis at the local level. Almost all events were streamed live online, and online consultations were rapidly expanding to provide safe consultations and medical subscriptions to end-users. The Internet has long been a reliable primary source of health information, but there has always been a question about the data's authenticity. You or someone you know may have needed immediate medical assistance several times, but they've been unavailable for a variety of reasons. As a result, online consultation and medical services are being designed and developed to deal with these issues.
